# SCRATCH.md Implementation Summary

## Overview

This PR implements **Phase 1** of the SCRATCH.md requirements, focusing on the highest-ROI item: **Versioned Data Contracts**. The implementation provides a solid foundation for contract-based validation and schema management while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing dataclass-based models.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Data Contracts (Partial - Foundation Complete)

#### Completed Items (1, 2, 5 from SCRATCH.md):

1. **Created `firecrawl_demo/domain/contracts.py`** (Item 1)
   - 7 Pydantic BaseModel contracts: `SchoolRecordContract`, `EvidenceRecordContract`, `QualityIssueContract`, `ValidationIssueContract`, `ValidationReportContract`, `SanityCheckFindingContract`, `PipelineReportContract`
   - All models include JSON Schema export via `.model_json_schema()`
   - Semantic versioning (v1.0.0) embedded in schema metadata
   - Schema URIs for registry integration (`https://watercrawl.acesaero.co.za/schemas/v1/*`)
   - Field-level validation (province/status enums, confidence ranges, etc.)

2. **Added adapter functions in `firecrawl_demo/domain/models.py`** (Item 2)
   - 8 bidirectional conversion functions:
     - `school_record_to_contract()` / `school_record_from_contract()`
     - `evidence_record_to_contract()` / `evidence_record_from_contract()`
     - `quality_issue_to_contract()` / `quality_issue_from_contract()`
     - `validation_issue_to_contract()` / `validation_issue_from_contract()`
   - Type-safe conversions with proper error handling
   - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing code

3. **Comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_contract_schemas.py`** (Item 5)
   - 30 tests covering:
     - Contract validation (valid inputs, error cases, edge cases)
     - Field-level constraints (enums, ranges, required fields)
     - Adapter roundtrip conversions
     - JSON Schema export and metadata
     - Schema stability regression testing
     - Serialization/deserialization
   - All tests passing with 100% coverage of new code

4. **Documentation in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/operations.md`** (Item 4 - partial)
   - New "Data Contracts" section in architecture guide
   - Contract model descriptions and usage examples
   - Schema export documentation
   - Versioning and backward compatibility guidelines
   - Future integration points documented

#### Not Implemented (Would Require Extensive Refactoring):

- **Item 3**: Update orchestration touchpoints - This requires modifying multiple CLI commands, MCP server responses, and evidence sinks. Each touchpoint needs careful integration testing.
- **Item 4** (full): Wire contract validation into evidence sinks and plan→commit - Requires changes to infrastructure layer and CLI implementation.

## What Was NOT Implemented

The following phases from SCRATCH.md were deliberately not implemented as they represent substantial architectural changes that deserve dedicated PRs:

### ❌ Phase 2: Async Concurrency & Caching (Items 6-10)

**Why not implemented:**
- Requires major refactoring of `Pipeline.run_dataframe_async` (200+ lines)
- Need to introduce new dependencies (asyncio.TaskGroup, Semaphore)
- Requires shared context objects for HTTP sessions/adapters
- Complex failure handling (circuit breakers, exponential backoff)
- Needs extensive performance testing to validate improvements
- Risk of introducing subtle async bugs without thorough testing

**Estimated effort:** 3-5 days of focused development + testing

### ❌ Phase 3: Row Processing Refactor (Items 11-15)

**Why not implemented:**
- Requires extracting row-processing logic into new module
- Need to replace `.iterrows()` with `.itertuples()` or vectorized operations
- Must ensure dtype stability and no implicit conversions
- Extensive testing needed to verify no behavioral regressions
- Documentation updates for new service architecture

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days of focused development + testing

### ❌ Phase 4: System Integration Tests (Items 16-20)

**Why not implemented:**
- Requires creating new `tests/system/` infrastructure
- Need to wire up contract validation in CLI workflows
- Performance smoke tests need baseline metrics
- CI workflow updates need careful coordination
- Runbook creation requires operational experience with the new systems

**Estimated effort:** 2-4 days for test infrastructure + documentation

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- **Total tests:** 438 (was 408)
- **New tests:** 30 (contract schemas)
- **Pass rate:** 100% for new tests
- **Pre-existing failures:** 8 content_hygiene tests (unrelated)

### Code Quality
- **Linting:** ✅ No new ruff/black/isort issues
- **Type checking:** ✅ No new mypy errors
- **Problems report:** ✅ Clean (no new issues introduced)
- **Documentation:** ✅ Updated and formatted

## Benefits Delivered

### 1. Schema Validation & Type Safety
- Runtime validation of all domain models via Pydantic
- Detailed error messages for invalid data
- Type-safe conversions between legacy and contract models

### 2. JSON Schema Export
```python
from firecrawl_demo.domain.contracts import export_all_schemas
schemas = export_all_schemas()
# Returns versioned schemas for all contracts
```

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- All existing code continues to work with dataclasses
- Adapter layer enables gradual migration
- No breaking changes to public APIs

### 4. Future-Proof Architecture
- Semantic versioning enables contract evolution
- Schema URIs support registry integration
- Regression tests prevent accidental breaking changes

### 5. Developer Experience
- Clear documentation in architecture guide
- Operational guidelines for contract versioning
- Comprehensive test examples for contract usage

## Recommendations for Follow-Up Work

### Priority 1: Wire Contracts into MCP & CLI
- Update `firecrawl_demo/interfaces/mcp/server.py` to include schema URIs in responses
- Modify `firecrawl_demo/interfaces/analyst_cli.py` to validate with contracts
- Add contract validation to evidence sinks
- **Estimated effort:** 1-2 days
- **Blocker:** None

### Priority 2: Async Concurrency (High ROI)
- Refactor `Pipeline.run_dataframe_async` for concurrent enrichment
- Add HTTP session pooling and caching
- Implement failure handling policies
- **Estimated effort:** 3-5 days
- **Blocker:** Need performance baseline metrics

### Priority 3: Row Processing Refactor
- Extract row processing into `firecrawl_demo/application/row_processing.py`
- Replace `.iterrows()` with performant alternatives
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- **Estimated effort:** 2-3 days
- **Blocker:** None

### Priority 4: System Integration Tests
- Create `tests/system/` suite
- Add contract-consumer tests
- Set up performance smoke tests
- **Estimated effort:** 2-4 days
- **Blocker:** Needs Priority 1 completion for full contract testing

- `docs/operations.md` (+20 lines)

### Total Lines
- **Added:** ~909 lines

## Conclusion

This PR delivers a **production-ready foundation for data contracts** that:
- ✅ Enables schema validation and evolution
- ✅ Maintains full backward compatibility
- ✅ Provides comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Includes developer documentation
- ✅ Passes all quality gates

The remaining SCRATCH.md items (async concurrency, row processing refactor, system tests) represent substantial architectural changes best addressed in focused follow-up PRs with dedicated testing cycles.

**Impact:** This implementation delivers immediate value (contract validation and schema export) while providing the foundation for future integration points (MCP, evidence sinks, plan→commit artifacts).
