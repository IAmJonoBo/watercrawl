# ACES Aerodynamics Enrichment Stack

Welcome to the consolidated intelligence and enrichment toolkit for ACES Aerodynamics. This stack transforms raw flight-school datasets into fully validated, evidence-backed records aligned with POPIA and SACAA expectations.

## What you get

- **Robust validation** for South African provincial, contact, and status fields.
- **Deterministic enrichment** flows that fill missing data via research adapters and compliance heuristics.
- **CLI + MCP automation** so GitHub Copilot or operators can orchestrate quality checks.
- **MkDocs documentation** to capture methodology, governance, and operational playbooks.

Use the navigation to drill into the gap analysis, target architecture, data-quality methodology, and automation interfaces.
