# Dependency Access and Optimization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all improvements made to ensure reliable dependency downloads and optimize CI/CD performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files

#### `.config/pip/pip.conf` (NEW)
- Global pip configuration with 60-second timeout
- 5 retry attempts for failed downloads
- Prefer binary packages for faster installation
- Progress bar enabled for visibility

#### `poetry.toml` (UPDATED)
- Added `max-workers = 10` for parallel installation
- Maintains in-project virtualenv configuration

#### `.npmrc` (UPDATED)
- Network timeout: 60 seconds (60000ms)
- Fetch retries: 5 attempts
- Exponential backoff: 10-60 seconds
- Retry timing configuration for optimal resilience

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

All workflows updated with:

#### Environment Variables
- `PIP_TIMEOUT=60` and `PIP_RETRIES=5` for Poetry steps
- `POETRY_INSTALLER_MAX_WORKERS=10` for parallel downloads
- `PNPM_NETWORK_TIMEOUT=60000` and `PNPM_FETCH_RETRIES=5` for pnpm steps

#### Caching Improvements
- Added Poetry cache to `collect-problems.yml`
- Added Poetry cache to `copilot-setup-steps.yml`
- Added pnpm cache to `ci.yml`, `deploy-docs.yml`, `techdocs.yml`
- Cache keys use lockfile hashes for optimal invalidation

#### Version Upgrades
- Updated `actions/setup-node@v4` → `v6` across workflows
- Updated `actions/setup-python@v5` → `v6` in copilot-setup-steps
- Standardized Node.js version to 22 across workflows

#### Concurrency Controls
Added to prevent wasteful duplicate runs:
- `ci.yml`
- `pnpm-validate.yml`
- `collect-problems.yml`
- `deploy-docs.yml`
- `techdocs.yml`

Settings:
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

#### CI Workflow Matrix
- Added `fail-fast: false` to allow all Python versions to run independently

### 3. Docker Configuration

#### `Dockerfile` (UPDATED)
- Poetry installation with `--timeout 60 --retries 5`
- Environment variables for dependency installation:
  - `PIP_TIMEOUT=60`
  - `PIP_RETRIES=5`

### 4. New GitHub Actions

#### `.github/actions/setup-python-deps/action.yml` (NEW)
Reusable composite action for Python dependency setup with:
- Automatic Poetry installation with timeout/retry
- Poetry cache configuration
- Parameterized dev/production dependency installation
- Environment variable management

### 5. Development Tools

#### `justfile` (UPDATED)
Updated recipes with environment variables:
- `install`: Sets `PIP_TIMEOUT`, `PIP_RETRIES`, `POETRY_INSTALLER_MAX_WORKERS`
- `install-dev`: Same timeout/retry protection
- `test-deps` (NEW): Verify dependency configuration

#### `scripts/test_dependency_config.sh` (NEW)
Comprehensive test script that validates:
- pip configuration file and settings
- Poetry configuration
- pnpm configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow settings
- Dockerfile configuration
- Bundled binary availability

Returns color-coded pass/fail results and summary.

### 6. Documentation

#### `docs/dependency-resilience.md` (NEW)
Complete guide covering:
- Problem statement and solutions
- Configuration details for pip, Poetry, pnpm
- Workflow update patterns
- Docker optimization
- Caching strategies
- Benefits and monitoring
- Future enhancements

#### `docs/dependency-troubleshooting.md` (NEW)
Troubleshooting guide with:
- Quick diagnosis steps
- Common issues and solutions
- Environment verification commands
- Performance tips
- Getting help resources

#### `README.md` (UPDATED)
Added section on dependency download resilience with:
- Overview of timeout/retry configurations
- Link to test script
- Reference to detailed documentation

## Benefits

### Reliability
- **Automatic retries**: Handle transient network failures gracefully
- **Increased timeouts**: Accommodate slow connections and large packages
- **Parallel downloads**: Faster installation with Poetry max-workers
- **Caching**: Reduce redundant downloads across workflow runs

### Performance
- **Concurrency controls**: Prevent duplicate workflow runs on rapid pushes
- **Cache optimization**: Lockfile-based cache keys for accurate invalidation
- **Parallel installation**: 10 workers for Poetry, improving speed
- **Binary preference**: Faster installation by preferring pre-built wheels

### Developer Experience
- **Consistent configuration**: Same settings across local, CI, and Docker
- **Easy verification**: Test script validates all configurations
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- **Justfile integration**: Simple commands with proper environment setup

### CI/CD Efficiency
- **Reduced failures**: Fewer network-related build failures
- **Cost savings**: Fewer re-runs due to timeouts
- **Faster builds**: Better caching and parallel downloads
- **Resource optimization**: Concurrency controls prevent wasteful runs

## Testing

All configurations verified by:
1. Running `./scripts/test_dependency_config.sh` - All 17 tests pass
2. CodeQL security scan - No vulnerabilities found
3. Manual verification of workflow file changes

## Metrics

### Configuration Coverage
- **3** dependency managers configured (pip, Poetry, pnpm)
- **7** GitHub Actions workflows updated
- **1** reusable action created
- **1** Dockerfile optimized
- **17** configuration tests passing

### Documentation
- **2** new comprehensive guides
- **1** README section added
- **1** justfile with new recipes

## Maintenance

To maintain these improvements:

1. **Regular testing**: Run `./scripts/test_dependency_config.sh` before releases
2. **Monitor CI**: Check for timeout/retry patterns in workflow logs
3. **Update timeouts**: Adjust if package registries or networks change
4. **Cache review**: Periodically review cache hit rates
5. **Documentation**: Keep troubleshooting guide updated with new issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified but not implemented (out of scope):

1. **PyPI mirror fallback**: Add alternate package index for failover
2. **Pre-download cache**: Populate cache with common packages
3. **Metrics collection**: Track dependency installation performance
4. **Custom retry strategies**: Different retry patterns per package type
5. **Network diagnostics**: Automated network connectivity tests
