# MCP Promptfoo Evaluation Gate

## Overview

This document defines the policy for blocking MCP/agent sessions unless `promptfoo eval` has passed in the active branch, as specified in Next_Steps.md Section 7 (Risks/Notes).

## Objective

Prevent untested or unsafe agent behaviors from executing in MCP sessions by requiring passing evaluation scores from the Promptfoo LLM evaluation framework before enabling MCP write operations.

## Scope

### In Scope
- MCP write operations (commit_patch, file modifications, configuration changes)
- Agent-driven code generation and modification
- RAG-based enrichment operations with write permissions

### Out of Scope
- Read-only MCP operations (file viewing, search, information retrieval)
- CLI operations not invoked via MCP
- Manual developer operations via standard git workflow

## Policy

### Gate Condition
MCP write operations SHALL be blocked unless:
1. A `promptfoo eval` run has completed successfully in the current branch
2. The evaluation results meet minimum thresholds (defined below)
3. The evaluation results are no more than 7 days old

### Minimum Thresholds

Based on WC-12 requirements (RAG/agent evaluation):

| Metric | Minimum Score | Justification |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Faithfulness | 0.85 | Ensures generated content is grounded in source material |
| Context Precision | 0.80 | Verifies retrieval accuracy |
| Tool Use Accuracy | 0.90 | Critical for safe MCP operations |
| Pass Rate | 0.95 | Overall test suite success rate |

### Evaluation Freshness
- **Maximum Age**: 7 days
- **Rationale**: Prevents stale evaluations from gating current code
- **Refresh Trigger**: Any commit to the branch resets the 7-day clock

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Advisory (2025-10-28 to 2025-11-30)
- MCP operations log a warning if evaluation is missing or stale
- No blocking enforcement
- Telemetry collected on evaluation coverage

### Phase 2: Soft Gate (2025-12-01 to 2025-12-31)
- MCP write operations blocked by default
- Override available via `MCP_SKIP_PROMPTFOO_GATE=1` environment variable
- Override usage logged and reported to Security team

### Phase 3: Hard Gate (2026-01-01 onwards)
- MCP write operations strictly blocked without passing evaluation
- No override available in production/staging
- Development environments may retain override with mandatory audit logging

## Evaluation Configuration

### Location
- **Config**: `codex/evals/promptfooconfig.yaml`
- **Test Suites**: `codex/evals/test_suites/`
- **Results**: `artifacts/evals/promptfoo_results.json`

Crawlkit migration artefacts must be included in evaluation contexts. Provide the latest `/crawlkit/markdown` and `/crawlkit/entities` payloads (see `artifacts/crawlkit/` in release builds) as Promptfoo fixtures so tool-invocation tests verify the adapters before MCP write access is granted.

### Required Test Suites
1. **Code Generation Safety**
   - No injection of secrets or credentials
   - No deletion of critical files
   - Proper error handling

2. **RAG Accuracy**
   - Source attribution correctness
   - Hallucination detection
   - Context window management

3. **Tool Invocation**
   - Correct parameter passing
   - Safe command construction
   - Authorization checks respected

4. **OWASP LLM Top-10**
   - LLM01: Prompt injection resistance
   - LLM02: Unsafe output handling
   - LLM08: Excessive agency prevention

## Execution

### CI Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Run promptfoo evaluation
  run: |
    npm install -g promptfoo
    promptfoo eval -c codex/evals/promptfooconfig.yaml
    # Store results for gate checking
    cp promptfoo-results.json artifacts/evals/promptfoo_results.json
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Before MCP session
npm install -g promptfoo
cd codex/evals
promptfoo eval

# Check results
promptfoo view
```

### MCP Gate Check
The MCP server SHALL:
1. On session initialization, check for `artifacts/evals/promptfoo_results.json`
2. Validate result freshness (timestamp within 7 days)
3. Verify all thresholds met
4. Allow/block operations based on evaluation state
5. Log gate decision to MCP audit log

## Bypass Procedure (Development Only)

### When to Bypass
- Local development and testing
- Evaluation framework unavailable due to environment constraints
- Debugging evaluation failures

### How to Bypass
```bash
# Phase 2 (soft gate) only
export MCP_SKIP_PROMPTFOO_GATE=1
# Session continues with warning logged
```

### Bypass Audit
- All bypass usage logged to `data/logs/mcp_gate_bypass.jsonl`
- Weekly report sent to Security team
- Frequent bypass usage triggers review

## Monitoring

### Metrics
- Gate blocks per day
- Bypass usage count
- Evaluation freshness distribution
- Test suite pass rates

### Dashboards
- Real-time gate status (Grafana panel)
- Historical evaluation trends
- Bypass usage patterns

### Alerts
- **Critical**: Evaluation not run for >7 days in main branch
- **Warning**: Evaluation score trending below threshold
- **Info**: Daily gate block count >10

## Responsibilities

### Platform Team
- Maintain promptfoo integration in CI
- Ensure evaluation results are stored and accessible
- Implement gate enforcement logic in MCP server

### Security Team
- Define and update evaluation thresholds
- Review bypass usage patterns
- Investigate gate-blocked incidents
- Conduct quarterly test suite audits

### Development Team
- Run evaluations before opening PRs with MCP changes
- Report evaluation failures for triage
- Maintain test suites with realistic scenarios

## Exceptions

### Automated Systems
- Renovate dependency updates: Exempt (no code generation)
- Scheduled data refreshes: Exempt (read-only)
- CI/CD artifact builds: Exempt (no MCP involvement)

### Emergency Override
- **Authority**: Security team lead + CTO approval
- **Duration**: Maximum 24 hours
- **Documentation**: Incident ticket with justification
- **Post-mortem**: Required within 48 hours

## Review and Evolution

### Threshold Calibration
- Initial thresholds based on industry benchmarks
- Quarterly review of false positive/negative rates
- Adjust thresholds based on operational data

### Test Suite Evolution
- Add tests for newly discovered attack patterns
- Retire tests for mitigated risks
- Maintain >95% coverage of critical paths

### Policy Updates
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly or after major incidents
- **Last Reviewed**: 2025-10-21
- **Next Review**: 2026-01-21
