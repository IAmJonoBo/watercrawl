# Firecrawl Demo to Watercrawl Migration

This document describes the completed migration from `firecrawl_demo` to `watercrawl`.

## Overview

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Type**: Package rename and structure elevation  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Changes Summary

### Package Rename

The `firecrawl_demo` package has been completely renamed to `watercrawl` to:
- Remove all traces of "firecrawl" and "demo" terminology from the core package
- Align the package name with the repository name
- Better reflect the project's identity as a production enrichment toolkit
- Elevate `crawlkit` as the primary crawling engine

### Migration Scope

**Files Updated**: 187+ files across the entire codebase
- 103 Python source files
- 84 documentation and configuration files
- Build configuration (Dockerfile, justfile, pyproject.toml)
- GitHub configuration (CODEOWNERS, workflows via automation)

```

## Breaking Changes

### Import Updates Required

All code importing from `firecrawl_demo` must be updated:

**Before**:
```python
from firecrawl_demo.core import config
from firecrawl_demo.application.pipeline import enrich
from firecrawl_demo.interfaces.cli import main
```

**After**:
```python
from watercrawl.core import config
from watercrawl.application.pipeline import enrich
from watercrawl.interfaces.cli import main
```

### Configuration Updates

**pyproject.toml**:
- `packages`: Updated from `firecrawl_demo` to `watercrawl`
- `known_first_party`: Updated to include `watercrawl`
- `src`: Updated paths
- Tool-specific configs (ruff, mutmut) updated

**Dockerfile**:
- COPY commands updated to reference `watercrawl` instead of `firecrawl_demo`

**justfile**:
- Security scan paths updated
- Coverage report paths updated
- Metrics calculations updated

**.github/CODEOWNERS**:
- Team ownership paths updated from `/firecrawl_demo/*` to `/watercrawl/*`
- Added `/crawlkit/` ownership

## Preserved Functionality

### No Functional Changes

All business logic remains unchanged:
- ✅ Pipeline orchestration
- ✅ Data validation and quality checks
- ✅ Research adapters and integrations
- ✅ Contract validation (GX, dbt, Deequ)
- ✅ Lineage and lakehouse functionality
- ✅ MCP server and CLI interfaces
- ✅ Governance and safety modules

### Optional Firecrawl SDK Support

The external Firecrawl SDK integration remains available:
- Feature flag: `FEATURE_ENABLE_FIRECRAWL_SDK=1`
- Compatibility adapter: `crawlkit.adapter.firecrawl_compat`
- Optional integration with external Firecrawl service

## Verification

### Automated Checks Passed

✓ Directory structure verified (watercrawl/ exists, firecrawl_demo/ removed)  
✓ No `firecrawl_demo` imports in active source code  
✓ Configuration files correctly updated  
✓ All 8 watercrawl subdirectories present and intact  
✓ Crawlkit package imports successfully  

### Manual Testing Recommendations

For teams integrating this change:

1. **Update Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root --with dev
   ```

2. **Update Imports**:
   - Search codebase for `firecrawl_demo` references
   - Replace with `watercrawl`

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

4. **Verify CLI**:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m apps.analyst.cli overview
   ```
