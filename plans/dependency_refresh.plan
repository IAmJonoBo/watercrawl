Task: Refresh dependency matrix and wheel status for cp314/cp315 blockers.
Scope:
- Run python -m scripts.dependency_matrix survey to regenerate tools/dependency_matrix/report.json.
- Use scripts/provision_wheelhouse.py to mark blocker wheels built or vendored and update tools/dependency_matrix/wheel_status.json.
- Re-run python -m scripts.dependency_matrix guard to refresh tools/dependency_matrix/status.json once blockers resolved or documented.
Assumptions:
- No new blockers beyond presets/dependency_blockers.toml.
- Wheel builds may be simulated/offline via provision script.
Planned Outputs:
- Updated report.json, wheel_status.json, status.json with current survey + guard results.
- Log updates in Next_Steps.md.
Risks:
- Missing dependencies for wheel build script; treat as advisory and document failures.
- Guard may remain red if blockers unresolved; capture rationale.
