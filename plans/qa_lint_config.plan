Title: QA lint configuration remediation
Summary: Ensure automation CLI lint suite runs by addressing configuration issues and missing dependencies.
Steps:
  - Add an explicit development dependency on click so automation CLI entrypoints resolve without relying on transitive deps.
  - Tweak Black configuration to drop unsupported Python 3.14 target until the formatter releases support.
  - Adjust isort configuration to skip vendored stub directories that currently trigger mass import-order violations.
  - Guard the SQLFluff runner against missing duckdb by downgrading to a friendly skip so lint aggregation can proceed in envs without duckdb wheels.
Rationale: Prior QA runs failed due to missing click import, Black target-version parsing errors, isort scanning vendored stubs, and hard duckdb import requirements. These changes unblock the lint aggregate without touching runtime packages.
