Task: Strengthen offline bootstrap cache assertions and tooling.
Scope:
- Update scripts/bootstrap_env.py to fail fast when --offline is requested without cached Playwright browsers, tldextract data, Node tarballs, or pip wheel caches.
- Extend scripts/download_wheelhouse_artifact.py (or sibling helper) to seed the local pip cache and document offline cache priming in docs/ephemeral-qa-guide.md.
- Expand tests/test_bootstrap_env.py to cover offline cache validation paths and preflight reporting; ensure plan artefacts emitted by --dry-run are exercised.
Assumptions:
- Offline caches live under artifacts/cache/ and pip wheels mirror to artifacts/cache/pip by default (UV_CACHE_DIR respected).
- Tests can simulate caches with temporary directories without invoking network installs.
Planned Outputs:
- Modified bootstrap_env logic with explicit pip cache validation and clearer error messages.
- New helper or extended wheelhouse downloader that stages pip caches locally plus documentation updates.
- Additional pytest coverage for offline validations including dry-run failure messaging and plan artefact capture expectations.
Risks:
- Existing baseline lint/type debt remains unresolved; target new code paths with focused tests and annotations.
- CI environment differences for UV_CACHE_DIR may require dynamic path handling; document fallback behaviour.
