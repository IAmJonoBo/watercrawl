# Application Surface

The `app/` directory hosts deployable application components (CLI entry points, API layers, UI adapters) that consume the
core enrichment libraries. Code promoted here must already satisfy lineage, lakehouse, and versioning gates.

Guidelines:

- Depend on shared primitives from `firecrawl_demo/` rather than duplicating logic.
- Reference the manifests generated by the lakehouse and versioning managers to surface reproducible dataset details in any UI
  or API response.
- Keep environment-specific overrides out of `app/`; direct those into `dev/` or `dist/` to maintain separation of concerns.
